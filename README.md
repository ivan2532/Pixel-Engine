# Pixel Engine

The Pixel Engine is a software renderer made purely for educational purposes. It is very unoptimised and falls far short of the performance that a hardware-accelerated renderer could deliver. Its goal is to demystify everything that goes behind the scenes when you are using a graphics API, like OpenGL or DirectX, so that you can have a full understanding of the most critical concepts in computer graphics, which is crucial for writing a hardware-accelerated renderer.

The Pixel Engine was made in the [Chilli DirectX Framework](https://github.com/planetchili/chili_framework) that will provide us with the PutPixel function, hence the name “Pixel Engine”. This function takes a colour and screen coordinates as arguments, and colours the pixel at those coordinates. Using just that, we will build a 3D renderer. This project was heavily inspired by [Chilli’s 3D Programming Fundamentals YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehGqieEbus&list=PLqCJpWy5Fohe8ucwhksiv9hTF5sfid8lA&ab_channel=ChiliTomatoNoodle), which I highly recommend everyone getting into 3D graphics to watch.

## Requirements
The only requirement is that you will need to use Windows to run the project, since it uses DirectX in the background.

## Documentation
You can find a document that discusses all the theory behind the engine and its implementation in detail [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xWjy3uPwlTREEfZ6n3kIMqPDFHllUxOU0w7RhLeziE0/edit?usp=sharing).
